* Project Description:
* This project must be built before Bootloadable project.
*
* If USB connector is plugged in, the main()function of this program calls the 
* CyBtldr_Start() API. This API performs the entire bootload operation. It 
* communicates with the host. After a successful bootload operation, this API 
* passes control to the application via a software reset.
